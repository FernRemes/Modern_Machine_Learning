# Image Classifier

This project is to be used to learn and understand about Machien Learning. Using the data from cifar10 dataset we can create a program that is tasked to identify and classify image absed on the dataset.

![The CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Requirements

- numpy
- streamlit
- tensorflow
- Image from PIL
- cifar-10

## Files
 The python file main.py is the creation of the model, and the the second file is creating the html webbrowser to utilize the trained model.

 1. Run main.py
 2. wait for the 30 echos of the training (default iterations) (can be changed)
 3. run trained_model.py
    - type in terminal:
        ```bash
        python -m streamlit run trained_model.py

 4. upload an image
